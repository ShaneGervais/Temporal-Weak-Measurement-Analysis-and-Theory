# Temporal-Weak-Measurement-Analysis-and-Theory

The weak value for our system is based on a temporal weak interaction on the horizontal basis state of the incoming polarized laser pulse. The result gives a change in the pulses temporal position used to calculate the real part of the polarization states weak value and a frequency shift in its spectrum used to calculate the imaginary part of the systems weak value.

This library provides the essential programmes to retrieve the real and imaginary part of the weak value for different input states of a polarization path. (See masters project)

This also provides the theoretical analysis via a notebook, highlighting the theoretical expectations for the real and imaginary part of the weak value.

# Note: 

The imaginary part was calculated based on the power density spectrum of the laser pulse and not its frequnecy spectrum since our project aimed to measure a quantum state in a cost effective way. However, using a spectrometer, one could measure the frequnecy shift in its frequnecy spectra using the same two techniques imployed for the imaginary part i.e. fitting a curve on the spectra peak one views the weak measurement effect or observing the centroid shift which is used in this technique as well. Our results for the fitting technique are random due to incoherency in our source. (SEE masters project for more information)
